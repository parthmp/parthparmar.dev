		<h2 class="second-header">About Me</h2>
		<br>
		<p>I'm a fullstack programmer with over 10 years of experience building web applications and software solutions for clients and companies worldwide. I specialize in creating robust, scalable systems using modern technologies, frequently leveraging Laravel and Vue.js, while remaining flexible to use the right tools for each project.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Throughout my career, I've worn many hats: leading development teams, architecting complex applications, and collaborating directly with clients to bring their ideas to life. I've built everything from social media platforms and real estate portals to systems regulated by US government agencies and custom WordPress themes. 
			<br>
			<br>
			My approach combines technical expertise with a strong focus on security, code quality, and user experience.</p>
		<br>
		<p>When I'm not coding, I'm either learning new technologies or diving into science and educational content. I'm a firm believer in facts, evidence based thinking, and continuous learning.</p>
