		<h2 class="second-header">About me</h2>
		<br>
		<p>I'm a fullstack programmer with over 10 years of experience building web applications and software solutions for companies and clients worldwide. I specialize in creating robust, scalable systems using modern technologies like Laravel & Vue.js.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Throughout my career, I've worn many hats: leading development teams, architecting complex applications, and working directly with clients to turn their ideas into reality. I've built everything from social media platforms and real estate portals to US government-regulated systems and custom WordPress themes. 
			<br>
			<br>
			My approach combines technical expertise with a strong focus on security, code quality, and user experience.</p>
		<br>
		<p>When I'm not coding, I'm either learning new technologies or diving into science and educational content. I'm a firm believer in facts, evidence-based thinking, and continuous learning.</p>
