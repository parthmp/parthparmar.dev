					<p class="text-xl">I highly recommend Parth for your next project. He listened to my needs and did all that was asked. He actually finished ahead of schedule. I have farmed a few jobs to Upwork and this experience was by far the most pleasant. For my next job, Parth will be my first choice if he is available. 5 of 5 stars</p>

					<p class="text-xl">It was simply great from beginning to end. Parth was very good at keeping me in the loop. He even did more than was asked of him. I was very very glad with his work. Strongly recommend to anyone.</p>
